# Go code style

In iCore we follow the standard Go code style.

You can read it at the following links:
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). The document contains some advice on established conventions to guide decisions around naming, layout, and file organization.
* [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments). The document contains a collection of very short essays about details of Go idiom that are often missed by programmers.
